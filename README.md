Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool
Overview
The Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool is a Python-based utility designed to perform simple encryption and decryption of messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher is one of the most basic encryption algorithms in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This tool can handle both encryption and decryption by shifting letters based on a given key (shift value).

How the Caesar Cipher Works
The Caesar Cipher works by substituting each letter of the plaintext with a letter that is a fixed number of positions away in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

A becomes D
B becomes E
C becomes F
And so on...
The decryption process simply reverses the shift to restore the original message.

Key Features
Encryption: Enter any message and a shift value, and the tool will output the encrypted message. The shift wraps around the alphabet, ensuring the correct substitution even at the end of the alphabet.

Decryption: You can also use the tool to decrypt messages by entering the encrypted message and using the same shift value to reverse the cipher and retrieve the original message.

Support for both upper and lower case letters: The tool distinguishes between upper and lower case letters and maintains the case of the letters during the encryption and decryption process.

Handling of Non-Alphabetical Characters: Non-alphabetic characters such as numbers, spaces, punctuation, etc., are not altered and remain the same in the output.

Usage Example
Encrypting a Message
Suppose you want to encrypt the message:

"Hello, World!"
with a shift value of 3. The tool will convert it to:

"Khoor, Zruog!"
Decrypting a Message
To decrypt the above message back to its original form, simply use the same shift value of 3 and it will return:

"Hello, World!"
Implementation Details
The Caesar Cipher tool is implemented in Python and follows these steps:

Input: The user is prompted to enter the message and the desired shift value.
Shifting: For each alphabetic character in the message, the character's ASCII value is modified by the shift value.
Wrapping: If the shifted value exceeds the range of the alphabet (either uppercase or lowercase), the algorithm wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.
Output: The resulting encrypted or decrypted message is displayed to the user.
How to Run the Tool
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ritesh-r99/caeser-cipher.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd caeser-cipher
Run the Python script:

python caesar-cipher.py
Conclusion
The Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool is an educational and simple-to-use program for understanding the fundamentals of encryption. It's a great starting point for learning about cryptography and how text-based encryption works. Although the Caesar Cipher is not suitable for modern secure communication, it introduces core concepts like substitution ciphers.
